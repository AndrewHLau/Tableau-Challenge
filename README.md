Analysis

My story starts off with a map of all the starting stations and how often they were used as a starting location in June 2020.
The top five starting stations in June 2020 were as follows:

12 Ave & W 40th st, 
1 Ave & E68th st, 
West St & Chambers st, 
Broadway & W60th st, 
Pier 40 - Hudson River Park

Next, I decided to take a look at average trip duration in June for the year 2017 through 2020. Overall in was up and down. It increased from about 18 minutes in 2017 to just over 20 minutes in 2018, then it dipped back to 18 and half minutes in 2019. However, in 2020 it increased sharply to over 27 minutes. 

I also wanted to look at growth in riders year over year. June 2018 had 221,509 more riders than 2017 or a growth of 12.79%. June 2019 had 172,267 more riders than 2018 or 8.82% growth. However, June 2020 had 243,097 less riders than June of 2019 or a reduction of -11.44%. Over the entire period ridership increased in the month of June by 150.679 or an increase of 8.69%.

Another interesting topic to dive into would be the top 10 most popular start stations in June from 2017 to 2020. Pershing Square North was the most popular for 3 years in a row, but then did not even make the top 10 in 2020. In 2019, riders started at that station 14,778 times, but in 2020 only 4,905 times. That's a decrease of over 66%!  West St. & Chambers St was in the top 3 for all 4 years. 

Additionally a Gender analysis was in order because CitiBike is trying to increase female ridership. A set of Gender Pie charts shows the ratio of females vs males increased slightly each year from 2017 through 2019, but then reversed sharply in 2020. The ratio was 41.48% in 2017, then 42.28% in 2018, then 42.99% in 2019, and then 35.95% in 2020. Finally, the bar charts show an increase in female ridership from 2018 to 2019, and then a large decrease in 2020.

The final page in this story shows that younger riders have longer average trip duration, but not by much as shown by a trend line that is almost horizontal. A slope of just 1.9 (in seconds) when the average trip duration is over 27 minutes.
